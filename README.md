### Code Review
    The project in question is a current online game called Free Infantry Online, a defunct Harmless Games/Sony game. A group of dedicated software developers (including myself) decided to continue their legacy with Sony's expressed permission. For this game written in C#.Net, I decided to create a new launcher that will allow a person to log into the game. The launcher is designed and programmed by me with graphics provided be another team member. Its function is to allow a user to connect to the account server and verify their credentials before given access to the game.

### Enhancement One: Software Engineering & Design
    In this category, the plan was to allow the software to have a one way communication line between the call functions and the forms. The return data would be event calls that gave the required responses only. I modified the forgot password button to have its own Windows Form. The functionality is to provide the user with a window that has a username and a password button which will decide what the request is. After the user picks, it will send this data using JSON to the server and wait for a response. Once returned, it will tell the user their username or tell them to check their email for a password reset.

### Enhancement Two: Algorithms and Data Structure

## Self Introduction
<p align="left">
    I have been a programming since I was at the age of 18, starting with C in a Linux environment. My mentor at the time taught me the basic commands to move around and gave me a piece of coding that did not work. He told me that the shell was set up for me so it will not affect the actual game server, so feel free to test away.
In one month, not only did I learn C and how to navigate Linux, but I had the program working flawlessly. Since then, I have learned my languages and eventually, a desire to pursue programming as a career.

## Professional Self-Assessment

### Education
<p align="left">
    Over the years I have learned many different programming techniques, but it was not until going to college that I learned the most. Through these college years of research and studies, I have learned many things that I did not know about for a professional setting. Some of those include learning about the SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle), working in a team environment like agile, communication with stake and shareholders, or how to create diagrams for a class, sequence, or component. Another covered class was learning how to properly document using Pseudocode or a flowchart of your work. This is an important one because it shows how the program works from start to finish in more of an easier to read language, rather than code. Throughout many of the Computer Science courses, each class gave me a new perspective into the corporate world of software development and with it, a determination to make it my career.

### Strengths
<p align="left">
    For each assignment throughout my college courses, my attention to detail became more focused. I have always been a unit tester and problem solver, but now I have become more into double checking my work before a submit. Attention to detail was one of the course concepts of CS-499, and testing was another. Going back further, CS-250 taught me about the SDLC and communication with clients. CS-320 taught me how JUnit testing is conducted accurately and how it should be structured. In DAD-220, it opened my eyes to a different world of databases using MongoDB that I did not know of. With each new concept, it has enhanced my skills as a software developer and focus on the overall goal. Each iteration, documentation, and flowchart were double checked for errors, typos, and debugged. Using what I learned throughout these years I will take into the workforce with an opened mind. Even my team building, and collaboration skills have enhanced because of the team discussions that happened which was instilled into me during CS-340. All these concepts helped me hone my own program and allowed me to grow as a software developer and programmer.

### How It Fits Together
<p align="left">
    The project improvements for CS-499 Computer Science Capstone introduce some important aspects of the game launcher program that I wrote for a current online game. The idea was to have a retrieval button for the user to retrieve their username or password in case the user forgot it. The button could be clicked on, prompting the user with a choice of username or password. This was the Software Engineering and Design aspect of this course. Then, it would take that request and send it as a JSON serialized object using HTTP protocol to the account server. On the account server, it would deserialize it, check for validity, and send an HTTP response back. This is the Algorithm and Data Structures portion. Finally, for Databases, if the data was valid, then the account server would query the MSSQL database using the data provided to return either successful responses or a generated email with login information.

### Preparing For The Future
<p align="left">
    As the years intertwine, so does my knowledge of the software world and computers. With each class, my goal became even more clearer. A career as a developer is what I want. Although my current job as a Fighter Jet Mechanic is one passion, my heart lies as a developer. Some of the work requires sitting behind a computer and signing off work orders using the Navy's archaic database system. I find myself saying that I could enhance it or revitalize it and give the program a better user experience. Unfortunately, my job does not rely on programmers, but it does rely on problem solvers. In the Computer Sciences, this is a needed skill which college courses and the combination of classes have taught me that. All of these courses combined have prepared me to see the path that lies ahead and to follow it.
